My Better Concordia is a web application intended for professors to keep track of their roles as teachers, researchers, grant receivers, committee members and editorial board members. Our system uses a MySQL server as as database containing all the information regarding the teachers. The teacher is able to login using his/her credentials (email and password) and view a list of all courses they have taught. They can then view course information regarding these courses as well as the profiles of all the students they have taught. Grades of these students can be viewed (final letter grades, course component grades) as well as the average grade in a specific course. All of this information can also be filtered by semester or time-frame.

 Each teacher can view their personal profile which displays their personal information as well as a list of committees, workshops,  and conferences they attended along with their role in it. 

The professor can also manage his journal contributions from the website. They can see the journals for which they are on the editorial board, as well as the articles they reviewed for that journal. All other articles the journal has published along with their relevant information are also available. 

Teachers may view which research topics they are taking part in, the grants received for that research, and the grants received for all their research in total. The amount of grant money they have remaining, the students partaking in the research, and the funding the students received from the professor are displayed as well. The teacher may filter these students by year and/or position. 

All the pages of the website scale properly on any mobile device (tablets, cellphones, etc..) and do not make use of any front-end or back-end framework.
